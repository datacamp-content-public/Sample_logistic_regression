## What is classification?
 - It is a central topic in machine learning that has to do with teaching machines how to group together data by particular criteria. 
 - It is the process where computers group data together based on predetermined characteristics. 
 - There is an unsupervised version of classification, called clustering where computers find shared characteristics by which to group data when categories are not specified (we will encounter it later, not in this concept).
 - A common example of classification comes with detecting spam emails.
